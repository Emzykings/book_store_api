* Users have **14 days free borrowing**.
* After 14 days, fine = **500 units per day overdue**.


### üìù Notes
This project is designed for learning FastAPI concepts and is **in-memory only** (data resets when server restarts).
You can easily extend it with:
* Database integration (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
* User authentication
* Background tasks
* Caching for performance


### üèÜ Acknowledgements
Inspired by real-world library systems to serve as a group learning project and portfolio starter in learning FASTAPI.
